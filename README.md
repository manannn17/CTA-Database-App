# CTA-Database-App
The goal of this project is to write a console-based Python program that inputs 
commands from the user and outputs data from the CTA2 L daily ridership database.
SQL should be used to retrieve and compute most of the information, while Python is 
used to display the results and if the user chooses, to plot as well.
The Updated CTA2 L Daily Ridership Database
The updated CTA2 database consists of 5 tables: Stations, Stops, Ridership, 
StopDetails, and Lines. This provides information about both stations and stops in the L 
system.
The requirements were to use Python3 and SQL, and the provided SQLite 
database. All data retrieval and computation should be performed using explicit, stringbased SQL queries executed via the sqlite3 package; no tool-generated code is allowed.
